# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this challenge, I have decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I decide to do a climate analysis about the area.

I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. Specifically, I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib

I also desiged a Flask API based on the queries that I just developed

In the folder surfs up you can find my Jupyter notebook file with my queries for the analysis as well as my app.py file with my flask coding
